# FBLA-Competition-Library-Database-

This project was created for my FBLA competition that got me all the way to Nationals level (from Regional and States)

This project contains a .zip file which will contain the source code for the project.
It has a .sql file which will do the set up necessary to actually store the information in the database while
the other folder should be extracted and will have an executable which can be run.

The project ultilizes the Swing Library with Java for the front end  and uses MySQL for the back end. The JDBC API brings the project together allowing the connection between Java and MySQL. This project was created from the ground up with a little assistance from the NetBeans IDE for creating the many forms and interactive parts of the program.
