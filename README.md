# FBLA-Competition-Library-Database-

This project was created for my FBLA competition that got me all the way to Nationals level (from Regional and States)

This project contains a .zip file which will contain the source code for the project
It has a .sql file which will do the set up necessary to actually store the information in the database
The other folder should be extracted and will have an executable which can be run.
